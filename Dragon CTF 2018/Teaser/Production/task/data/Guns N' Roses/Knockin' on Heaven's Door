Mama, take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door

Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin' down
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door

You just better start sniffing your own rank subjugation, Jack
Because it's just you against your tattered libido
The bank and the mortician, forever, man
And it wouldn't be luck if you could get out of life alive

Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
