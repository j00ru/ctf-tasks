Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're O.K.
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money, get back
I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first-class traveling set
And I think I need a Learjet

Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away

"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!"
"I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in Number Two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out."
